# Explore the realm of HyperSDK
In this project, you will discover how to create your own optimized subnet (Hyperchain) on Avalanche with ease, offering a perfect foundation to enter the world of HyperSDK.
# Description
In this guide you will find a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up your own custom Subnet and deploy an EVM subnet using the Avalanche CLI. We'll also cover on how to link this Subnet to your MetaMask wallet by providing the correct RPC URL and other required information. After the subnet is created, you will also deploy two smart contracts onto it an ERC20 token contract and a Vault contract. Beaware that the Avalanche CLI might not install on some networks due to provider restrictions.
To access and run your code on remix you may use this link to open Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org/ .
# Initial Setup
To begin with, you need to install the Avalanche CLI on your local system running Ubuntu or Linux, Follow the installation instructions available at this link:https://docs.avax.network/tooling/cli-guides/install-avalanche-cli . Once installed, create and deploy your custom subnet by executing the following commands in your terminal:

``` avalanche subnet create mySubnet ```

```avalanche subnet deploy mySubnet```

These commands will allow you to create and deploy your own subnet using the Avalanche CLI.
